# Even though we set USER to a numeric ID in Dockerfile,
#   Openshift still (forcefully) sets yet another "random" UID for USER.
#   In that case 'whoami' cannot find a match for that UID in /etc/passwd,
#   and therefore cannot return the name against that ID,
#   eventually returning a non-zero exit-code.

if ! whoami &> /dev/null; then

  # As explained above, we reached this section because,
  #   whoami returned error, which is exactly what the above condition checks.
  #   So, now we create an entry for this user in /etc/passwd.
  # i.e. we set the USER_NAME as whatever we set RUNTIME_USER_NAME in Dockerfile,
  #      The user-id  (uid) as the uid forcefully set by openshift.
  #      USER_HOME as '/dev/null',  and login shell as '/sbin/nologin'.
